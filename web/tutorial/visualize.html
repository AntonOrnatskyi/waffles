<h2>Visualizing data</h2>
<p>One of the first tasks when working with some new data is to try to understand what's in the data, and how it is structured.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most commom way of visualizing some data is to list some basic stats about each of its attributes. For example, let's take a look at the iris dataset (which you can download from <a href="http://MLData.org">MLData.org</a>).
<pre>
	waffles_plot stats iris.arff
</pre>
This is one command that you should probably memorize, because you will use it frequently. Here is its output:
<pre>
	Filename: iris.arff
	Patterns: 150
	Attributes: 5 (Continuous:4, Nominal:1)
	  0) sepallength, Type: Continuous, Mean:5.8433333, Dev:0.82806613, Median:5.8, Min:4.3, Max:7.9, Missing:0
	  1) sepalwidth, Type: Continuous, Mean:3.054, Dev:0.43359431, Median:3, Min:2, Max:4.4, Missing:0
	  2) petallength, Type: Continuous, Mean:3.7586667, Dev:1.7644204, Median:4.35, Min:1, Max:6.9, Missing:0
	  3) petalwidth, Type: Continuous, Mean:1.1986667, Dev:0.76316074, Median:1.3, Min:0.1, Max:2.5, Missing:0
	  4) class, Type: Nominal, Values:3, Most Common:Iris-setosa (33.333333%), Entropy: 1.5849625, Missing:0
	     33.333333% Iris-setosa
	     33.333333% Iris-versicolor
	     33.333333% Iris-virginica
</pre>
As you can see, it shows some very basic information about each attribute in the dataset.
</p>

<p>Another common way to look at data is to plot the correlations between various attributes. The following command will generate such a plot for every pair of attributes.
<pre>
	waffles_plot overview iris.arff
</pre>
<center><img src="iris.png"></center><br>
Each plot at column <i>i</i>, row <i>j</i>, shows how well the value in attribute <i>i</i> can predict the value in attribute <i>j</i>. (So, if the last attribute is a class label, then the bottom row of the correlation plot matrix is usually the one in which you will be most interested.)</p>

<p>As another example, here are the overview plots from a subset of the attributes in the adult-census.arff dataset. (I only show a subset here because there are a lot of attributes in that dataset.)<br>
<pre>
	waffles_plot overview adult-census.arff
</pre>
<center><img src="adult-census.png"></center><br>
Several trends can be immediately observed in these plots. For example, it looks like most of the people in the census made less than $50K. It can be seen that age was somewhat correlated with a greater likelihood of making more than $50K. Those who indicated a marital status of "Married-civ-spouse" were much more likely to make more than $50K than those with other values in this attribute. Those who indicated that their relationship was either "wife" or "husband" were likely to make more than $50K, while those that indicated something else were less likely. It is clear from this chart that the significant majority of the people in the census indicated race to be "white", and that those who indicated "white" or "Asian-Pac-Islander" were more likely to make more than $50K than those with other values. It can be seen that males were more likely than females to make more than $50K. Apparently there were more males than females in this census. It looks like most people worked approximately 40 hours-per-week.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is, you can tell a lot about a dataset just by examining the overview plots.</p>
