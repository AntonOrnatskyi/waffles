<h2>Collaborative filtering</h2>

<p>Suppose that you decide to measure the accuracy of two algorithms using the soybean dataset:
<pre>
	waffles_learn crossvalidate -seed 0 soybean.arff naivebayes
	waffles_learn crossvalidate -seed 0 soybean.arff bag 64 decisiontree end
</pre>
The "naivebayes" model gets a predictive accuracy score of 0.778, and the ensemble model scores 0.245. You might conclude, therefore, that naive Bayes is a better model for this problem. Such a conclusion, however, would be premature because very little analysis has been done. If you look at the basic stats of this dataset,
<pre>
	waffles_plot stats soybean.arff
</pre>
you will see that many values are missing in this dataset. Let's try filling in those missing values, and see how it affects the results.</p>

<p>A collaborative filter is a technique that predicts values for all the missing elements in a matrix. Let's use the "baseline" collaborative filter, which simply predicts the mode value for each attribute:
<pre>
	waffles_recommend fillmissingvalues soybean.arff baseline > soy_dense.arff
</pre>
Now, let's use cross-validation again to measure accuracy with the same two algorithms. This time, "naivebayes" scores 0.998, and the ensemble model scores 1. You read that correctly--1--a perfect score. Filling in those missing values made a pretty dramatic difference in this case. So, which algorithm is better for this problem, naive Bayes or a bagging ensemble of 64 decision trees? Who cares? It seems to me that the real winner here is collaborative filtering.</p>

<p>We provide a few other collaborative filters besides "baseline". Some of them will make more intelligent predictions with many problems. To see a full list of the collaborative filtering algorithms, see the full usage information for the waffles_recommend tool:
<pre>
	waffles_recommend usage
</pre></p>

<h3>Recommendation systems</h3>

<p>Another common use for collaborative filters is to build a recommendation system. If you are trying to build a recommendation system, then you may want to compare your algorithm with our collaborative filters. Cross-validation is a good way to to this:
<pre>
	waffles_recommend crossvalidate -maxrecs 10 mydata.arff neural 3 -addlayer 8
</pre>
In this example, we perform crossvalidaton to measure the accuracy of a neural-network-based collaborative filter, with 3 intrinsic dimensions and 8 hidden nodes. We only measure the prediction error of the 10 items with the highest predicted rating for each user (because real-world users rarely have patience to consider more than a small number of recommended items). The scores that this returns should indicate how well this collaborative-filtering algorithm works with your data, given the assumption that users will only consider about 10 recommendations.</p>

<p>Incidentally, our neural-network-based collaborative filtering algorithm also has some very nice scalability properties, so if you are planning to build a high-traffic web-site, this would be a good algorithm to evaluate.</p>

<p>We also provide functionality to generate precision-recall graphs, and ROC curves, which can be useful for evaluating collaborative filtering algorithms. For full details, see the usage information for the waffles_recommend tool.</p>
