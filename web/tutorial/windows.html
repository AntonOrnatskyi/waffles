<h2>Building on Windows</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition.</li>
	<li>File->Open->Project/Solution</li>
	<li>Open waffles/src/waffles.sln or waffles/demos/demos.sln</li>
	<li>Build (F7)</li>
	<li>Set the startup app to the app you want to try.</li>
	<li>Set arguments in Project->Properties->Debugging->Command Arguments</li>
	<li>Run it (F5)</li>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	I get an error about std::_cpp_min and std::_cpp_max not being defined.
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	Are you using Visual Studio 2010? Microsoft made a breaking change related to this api in order to be more standards compliant (finally). We are not yet ready to drop support for Visual Studio 2008, however, so we have not yet ported to Visual Studio 2010. You can work around this by commenting out the macro related to _cpp_min and _cpp_max in GError.h.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	When I link the GClasses library to my project, I get a bunch of linker errors saying msvcrt.lib and libcmt.lib are fighting with each other.
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	On Windows, the GClasses library is built with the
	static runtime libraries to reduce dll-hell. If you  
	try to link it with your code, and your code uses the
	dynamic runtime libraries, you will get linker errors.
	The solution is to rebuild GClasses with dynamic
	runtime libraries, or rebuild your app with static
	runtime libraries. You can't mix static and dynamic
	libraries on Windows. If that doesn't help, you need to be careful to
	make sure that you build all of your libraries with the same settings.
	To do this, open your solution in VC++. In the Solution Explorer, right-click on GClasses, then click "Properties". Check the following settings, and make sure that they match the settings for your libraries and project: Configuration Properties->General->Use of MFC, Configuration Properties->C/C++->Code Generation->Basic Runtime Checks, and Configuration Propterties->C/C++->Code Generation->Runtime Library. If those all match and you still have problems, try use a diffing program to examine everything that differs between the GClasses.vcproj file and the .vcproj files for your program.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	When building for 64-bit architectures, some of the demo apps give a linker error about SDL.
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	We included a 32-bit version of the SDL library for Windows with Waffles for convenience, but we did not include a 64-bit version of this library. If you want to build the demos that use SDL for a 64-bit architecture, you will need to download a 64-bit version of the SDL library.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	I get errors while building GSocket.cpp.
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You probably have an outdated Windows SDK installed. The solution is to download and install the latest Windows SDK.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	How do I install Waffles?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	There is no install process for Windows. Just manually copy the executables that you use into some folder in your environment's path.
</div><br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">
	Where can I get more specific help?
</span><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">
	You can ask a question at our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/waffles/forums">forum</a>. If you
	post a question and you do not get a speedy response, please email me. Sometimes the email that is supposed
	to notify me that there is a new forum post is incorrectly classified as spam and discarded. (That's ironic,
	since I'm trying to develop better ML algorithms, isn't it?) My email address is on the main page.
