<h2>Neural network examples</h2>
<p>This document gives examples for writing code to use the neural network class in Waffles.</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Logistic regression</h3>

<p>Logistic regression is fitting your data with a single layer of logistic units. Here are the #includes that we are going to need for this example:</p>

<pre class="code">
	#include &lt;GClasses/GActivation.h&gt;
	#include &lt;GClasses/GHolders.h&gt;
	#include &lt;GClasses/GMatrix.h&gt;
	#include &lt;GClasses/GNeuralNet.h&gt;
	#include &lt;GClasses/GRand.h&gt;
	#include &lt;GClasses/GTransform.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>We are going to need some data, so let's load some data from an ARFF file. Let's use <a href="http://mldata.org/repository/data/download/arff/datasets-uci-iris/">Iris</a>,
a well-known dataset for machine learning examples:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GMatrix data;
	data.loadArff("iris.arff");
</pre>

<p>"data" is a 150x5 matrix. Next, we need to divide this data into a feature matrix (the inputs) and a label matrix (the outputs):</p>

<pre class="code">
	GDataColSplitter cs(data, 1); // the "iris" dataset has only 1 column of "labels"
	const GMatrix&amp; inputs = cs.features();
	const GMatrix&amp; outputs = cs.labels();
</pre>

<p>"inputs" is a 150x4 matrix of real values, and "outputs" is a 150x1 matrix of categorical values.
Neural networks typically only support continuous values, but the labels in the iris dataset are categorical, so we will convert them to use a real-valued representation
(also known as a categorical distribution, a one-hot representation, or binarized representation):</p>

<pre class="code">
	GNominalToCat nc;
	nc.train(outputs);
	GMatrix* pRealOutputs = nc.transformBatch(outputs);
</pre>

<p>pRealOutputs points to a 150x3 matrix of real values. Now, lets further divide our data into a training portion and a testing portion:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GRand r(0);
	GDataRowSplitter rs(inputs, *pRealOutputs, r, 75);
	const GMatrix&amp; trainingFeatures = rs.features1();
	const GMatrix&amp; trainingLabels = rs.labels1();
	const GMatrix&amp; testingFeatures = rs.features2();
	const GMatrix&amp; testingLabels = rs.labels2();
</pre>

Now, we are ready to train a layer of logistic units that takes 4 inputs and gives 3 outputs. In this example, we will also specify the learning rate:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GNeuralNet nn;
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(4, 3, new GActivationLogistic()));
	nn.setLearningRate(0.05);
	nn.train(trainingFeatures, trainingLabels);
</pre>

<p>Let's test our model to see how well it performs:</p>

<pre class="code">
	double sse = nn.sumSquaredError(testingFeatures, testingLabels);
	double mse = sse / testingLabels.rows();
	double rmse = sqrt(mse);
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "The root-mean-squared test error is " &lt;&lt; to_str(rmse) &lt;&lt; "\n";
</pre>

<p>Finally, don't forget to delete pRealOutputs:</p>

<pre class="code">
	delete(pRealOutputs);
</pre>

<p>Or, preferably:</p>

<pre class="code">
	Holder&lt;GMatrix&gt; hRealOutputs(pRealOutputs);
</pre>




<br><br>
<h3>Classification</h3>

<p>(This example builds on the previous one.)</p>

<p>The previous example was not actually very useful because root-mean-squared only tells us how poorly the neural network fit to our
continuous representation of the data. It does not really tell us how accurate the neural network is for classifying this data.
So, instead of transforming the data to meet the model, we can transform the model to meet the data. Specifically,
we can use the GAutoFilter class to turn the neural network into a classifier:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GAutoFilter af(&amp;nn, false); // false means the auto-filter does not need to "delete(&amp;nn)" when it is destroyed.
</pre>

<p>Now, we can train the auto-filter using the original data (with nominal labels). We no longer need to explicitly train
the neural network because when we train the auto-filter, it trains the inner model.</p>

<pre class="code">
	af.train(inputs, outputs);
</pre>

<p>The auto-filter automatically filters the data as needed for its inner model, but ultimately behaves as a model that can
handle whatever types of data you have available. In this case, it turns a neural network into a classifier, since "outputs"
contains 1 column of categorical values. So, now we can obtain the misclassification rate as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
	double mis = af.sumSquaredError(inputs, outputs);
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "The model misclassified " &lt;&lt; to_str(mis)  &lt;&lt;
		" out of " &lt;&lt; to_str(outputs.rows()) &lt;&lt; " instances.\n";
</pre>

<p>Why does a method named "sumSquaredError" return the total number of misclassifications? Because it uses Hamming distance for
categorical labels, which reports a squared-error of 1 for each misclassification.</p>

<p>(Note that if you are training a big network with big data, then efficiency may be critical. In such cases, it is generally better
to use the approach of transforming the data to meet the model, so that it does not waste a lot of time transformaing data during
training.)</p>



<br><br>
<h3>Adding layers</h3>

<p>To make a deeper neural network, you add more layers prior to training. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(784, 1000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(1000, 300));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(300, 90));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(90, 10));
</pre>

<p>The layers are added in feed-forward order. The first layer added is the input layer. The last layer added is the output layer.
Notice how the number of inputs into each layer should be the same as the number of outputs in the previous layer.
If they do not line up, then the existing layer will be resized to fit with the newly added layer. In other words, if
there is a conflict, the last one added to the neural network wins. Alternatively, you can also use the constant "FLEXIBLE_SIZE" to
indicate that you want the adjacent layer to determine the size. For example, following code results in the very same topology:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(784, 1000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 300));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 90));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 10));
</pre>

<p>When training begins, the number of inputs and outputs will also be resized to fit the training data. So, you can
use FLEXIBLE_SIZE for those too:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 1000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 300));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 90));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE));
</pre>

<p>That is as far as you can use FLEXIBLE_SIZE. If you use FLEXIBLE_SIZE anywhere else, then the size of one of the layers would be
ambiguous, which would be problematic.</p>



<br><br>
<h3>Activation functions</h3>

<p>If no activation function is specified, then the layer uses a default activation function. The default activation function for
GLayerClassic is GActivationTanH, which implements the tanh activation function. Many other activation functions are also available:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 1000, new GActivationRectifiedLinear()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 300, new GActivationSoftPlus()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 90, new GActivationGaussian()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, new GActivationIdentity()));
</pre>

<p>You can use the GLayerMixed class to make layers that contain a mixture of activation functions. In the following example,
the second layer has a size of 300, but it uses the softplus activation function for 150 of its units, and a sinusoid
activation function for the other 150 units:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 1000, new GActivationRectifiedLinear()));
	GLayerMixed* pMix = new GLayerMixed();
	pMix->addComponent(new GLayerClassic(1000, 150, new GActivationSoftPlus()));
	pMix->addComponent(new GLayerClassic(1000, 150, new GActivationSin()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(300, 90, new GActivationSinc()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, new GActivationBend()));
</pre>



<br><br>
<h3>Layer types</h3>

<p>There are several types of layers that you can use in your neural networks:
<ul>
	<li><b>GLayerClassic</b> - A traditional fully-connected feed-forward layer.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerMixed</b> - Allows you to combine multiple layers of different types into a single layer.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerRestrictedBoltzmannMachine</b>: A restricted boltzmann machine layer.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerConvolutional1D</b> - A 1-dimensional convolutional layer.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerConvolutional2D</b> - A 2-dimensional convolutional layer.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerSoftMax</b> - A soft-max layer, trained with cross-entropy.</li>
	<li><b>GLayerClassicCuda</b> - A GPU-optimized classic layer. Requires linking with the GCuda library.</li>
	<li>(Other layer types are currently under development...)</li>
</ul>



<br><br>
<h3>Stopping criteria</h3>

<p>The GNeuralNet::train method divides the training data into a training portion and a validation
portion. The default uses 65% for training and 35% for validation. Suppose you wanted to change this
ratio to 60/40. This would be done as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
	nn.setValidationPortion(0.4);
</pre>

<p>By default, training continues until validation accuracy does not improve by 0.2% over a window
of 100 epochs. If you wanted to change this to 0.1% over a window of 10 epochs, then you could do:

<pre class="code">
	nn.setImprovementThresh(0.001);
	nn.setWindowSize(10);
</pre>




<br><br>
<h3>Training incrementally</h3>

<p>Sometimes, it is preferable to train your neural network incrementally, instead of simply calling the "train" method.
For example, you might want to use a custom stopping criteria, you might want to report validation accuracy before
each training epoch, you might want to decay the learning rate in a particular manner, etc. The following example
shows how such things can be implemented:

<pre class="code">
	nn.beginIncrementalLearning(trainingFeatures.relation(), trainingLabels.relation());
	GRandomIndexIterator ii(trainingFeatures.rows(), nn.rand());
	for(size_t epoch = 0; epoch &lt; total_epochs; epoch++)
	{
		// Report validation accuracy
		double rmse = sqrt(nn1.sumSquaredError(validateFeatures, validateLabels) / validateLabels.rows());
		std::cout &lt;&lt; to_str(rmse) &lt;&lt; "\n";
		std::cout.flush();
	
		// Train
		ii.reset();
		size_t index;
		while(ii.next(index))
		{
			nn.trainIncremental(trainingFeatures[index], trainingLabels[index]);
		}
	
		// Decay the learning rate
		nn.setLearningRate(nn.learningRate() * 0.98);
	}
</pre>





<br><br>
<h3>Serialization</h3>

<p>You can write your neural network to a file:</p>

<pre class="code">
GDom doc;
doc.setRoot(nn.serialize(&amp;doc));
doc.saveJson("my_neural_net.json");
</pre>

<p>Then, you can load it from the file again:</p>

<pre class="code">
GDom doc;
doc.loadJson("my_neural_net.json");
GLearnerLoader ll;
GNeuralNet* pNN = (GNeuralNet*)ll.loadLearner(doc.root());
</pre>


<br><br>
<h3>GPU Parallelization</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to train your neural network in parallel on a GPU. For
class neural network layers, this is done by simply replacing GLayerClassic with GLayerClassicCuda.</p>

<p>For example, if you make your neural network like this,</p>

<pre class="code">
	GNeuralNet nn;
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 2000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 5000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 1000));
</pre>

<p>then all you need to do to parallelize it is change these lines to:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GCudaEngine e;
	GNeuralNet nn;
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassicCuda(e, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 2000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassicCuda(e, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 5000));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassicCuda(e, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 1000));
</pre>

<p>The GLayerClassicCuda class is not in the GClasses library. It is in the
GCuda library. To build this library, go into "src/depends/GCuda" and do
"sudo make install". (Subfolders of "depends" are not built by default
because they depend on things that some users may not have installed.)
Of course, you also need to have an NVIDIA GPGPU, and you have to link to a few
extra libraries: GCuda, curand, cublas, and cudart. The latter three
can all be obtained by installing the Cuda SDK. To help you get started,
there is a demo app in demos/cuda, which shows how this is done.</p>

<p>Currently only classic layers have a GPU-counterpart, but I am working
on parallelizig the other layer types too. I plan to have all functionality
available on the GPU ...eventually. (If you would like to help with this
effort, I would very much appreciate it.)</p>





<br><br>
<h3>MNIST</h3>

<p>These days, it has become very popular to test deep neural networks with the <a href="http://uaf46365.ddns.uark.edu/data/mnist/">MNIST dataset</a>.
So, let's do an example with it. First, some heading code:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;exception&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GApp.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GError.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GNeuralNet.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GActivation.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GTransform.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GHolders.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GVec.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GTime.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GDom.h&gt;

using namespace GClasses;
using std::cerr;
using std::cout;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
</pre>

<p>Now, let's load the dataset and divide it into features and labels. I am
also going to scale all the features by 1/256. (Note that manually scaling the features
in this way is not the same as applying normalizing transform to the features.
A normalizing transform would compute a unique range for each column, which would
cause background pixels with little variance to be scaled to fill the full range of values.
In this case, that would augment the noise in the features. Since all of the pixels have
meaning with respect to each other, we don't want to mess up those relationships.)</p>

<pre class="code">
	// Load and prep the training data
	GRand rand(0);
	GMatrix train;
	train.loadArff("mnist/train.arff");
	GDataColSplitter trainSplit(train, 1);
	trainSplit.features().multiply(1.0 / 256.0);
	GMatrix test;
	test.loadArff("mnist/test.arff");
	GDataColSplitter testSplit(test, 1);
	testSplit.features().multiply(1.0 / 256.0);
</pre>

<p>Now, let's make a neural network. One of my favorite activation functions is
GActivationBend, so I will use it. This activation function requires a smaller
learning rate, because its derivative is never close to zero. I will use a regular
sigmoidal layer in the output layer, however, because that tends to stabilize
training. Note that this is actually a really small network for this problem.
We could get much better results with a bigger network, but it is a good practice
to keep your initial experiments fast and simple, so you can make adjustments
without paying a heavy cost. Notice how I alternate between big and small
layers--that is a good trick for keeping the total number of network weights small.</p>

<pre class="code">
	// Make the networks
	GNeuralNet nn;
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 40, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 120, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 40, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 120, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE));
	nn.setLearningRate(0.01);
	GAutoFilter af(&amp;nn, false);
	af.beginIncrementalLearning(trainSplit.features().relation(), trainSplit.labels().relation());
	cout &lt;&lt; "Total weights: " &lt;&lt; to_str(nn.countWeights()) &lt;&lt; "\n";
</pre>

<p>Now, let's train it. I don't really do anything fancy here.</p>

<pre class="code">
	// Train
	GRandomIndexIterator ii(trainSplit.features().rows(), rand);
	for(size_t epoch = 0; epoch &lt; 10; epoch++)
	{
		// Validate
		double mis = af.sumSquaredError(testSplit.features(), testSplit.labels());
		cout &lt;&lt; "Misclassifications: " &lt;&lt; to_str(mis) &lt;&lt; "/" &lt;&lt; to_str(testSplit.labels().rows()) &lt;&lt; "\n";

		// Train
		ii.reset();
		size_t index;
		while(ii.next(index))
			af.trainIncremental(trainSplit.features()[index], trainSplit.labels()[index]);
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Training takes less than 2 minutes on a modest laptop computer. Here are the results that I get:</p>

<pre class="code">
Total weights: 47290
Misclassifications: 8865/10000
Misclassifications: 807/10000
Misclassifications: 649/10000
Misclassifications: 488/10000
Misclassifications: 512/10000
Misclassifications: 494/10000
Misclassifications: 412/10000
Misclassifications: 360/10000
Misclassifications: 346/10000
Misclassifications: 306/10000
</pre>

<p>Okay, now let's throw some more tricks onto the pile. Instead of going through the GAutoFilter
class, we will want to fiddle with the neural network directly, so we can access some of its more
specialized methods. Therefore, we will prefilter the labels, to get them in the right format
for the neural network (a representation consisting of all continuous values). There is no need
to prefilter the features in this case, because they are already in a form that neural networks can
handle. (We could if we wanted to, but it would be a no-op.)</p>

<p>So, let's use a convolutional input layer, and add two types of regularization: Dropout and Max-Norm.
I will highlight changes from the previous example in red:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;exception&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GApp.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GError.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GNeuralNet.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GActivation.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GTransform.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GHolders.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GVec.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GTime.h&gt;
#include &lt;GClasses/GDom.h&gt;

using namespace GClasses;
using std::cerr;
using std::cout;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	// Load and prep the training data
	GRand rand(0);
	GMatrix train;
	train.loadArff("mnist/train.arff");
	GDataColSplitter trainSplit(train, 1);
	trainSplit.features().multiply(1.0 / 256.0);
	GMatrix test;
	test.loadArff("mnist/test.arff");
	GDataColSplitter testSplit(test, 1);
	testSplit.features().multiply(1.0 / 256.0);

	// Make the networks
	GNeuralNet nn;
	nn.addLayer(new <font color="red">GLayerConvolutional2D(28, 28, 1, 7, 5,</font> new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, <font color="red">60</font>, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 40, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 120, new GActivationBend()));
	nn.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE));
	nn.setLearningRate(0.01);
	GAutoFilter af(&amp;nn, false);
	af.beginIncrementalLearning(trainSplit.features().relation(), trainSplit.labels().relation());
	cout &lt;&lt; "Total weights: " &lt;&lt; to_str(nn.countWeights()) &lt;&lt; "\n";
	<font color="red">GMatrix* pInnerLabels = af.prefilterLabels(trainSplit.labels());
	Holder&lt;GMatrix&gt; hInnerLabels(pInnerLabels);</font>

	// Train
	GRandomIndexIterator ii(trainSplit.features().rows(), rand);
	for(size_t epoch = 0; epoch &lt; 10; epoch++)
	{
		// Validate
		<font color="red">nn.scaleWeights(1.0 - 0.35, false, 1);</font>
		double mis = af.sumSquaredError(testSplit.features(), testSplit.labels());
		<font color="red">nn.scaleWeights(1.0 / (1.0 - 0.35), false, 1);</font>
		cout &lt;&lt; "Misclassifications: " &lt;&lt; to_str(mis) &lt;&lt; "/" &lt;&lt; to_str(testSplit.labels().rows()) &lt;&lt; "\n";

		// Train
		ii.reset();
		size_t index;
		while(ii.next(index))
		{
			<font color="red">for(size_t i = 0; i &lt; nn.layerCount(); i++)
				nn.layer(i).maxNorm(2.0);
			nn.trainIncrementalWithDropout</font>(trainSplit.features()[index], <font color="red">pInnerLabels-&gt;row(index), 0.35</font>);
		}
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>And here are some results. Notice they are not actually better. Is that because these tricks are no good? Is it
because this network has more weights and I didn't train for long enough? (Notice the accuracy is still improving.)
Is it because those tricks are really designed for larger networks, and this one is still so very small?
Is it because I didn't tune my hyperparameters at all? I will leave answering such questions as an exercize for
the reader--I'm just trying to show you how to use my code =).</p>

<h3>Inference with Generative Backpropagation</h3>

<p>Generative backpropagation enables feed-forward neural networks to be used for dimensionality
reduction, <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5394v1.pdf">imputation</a>, or collaborative filtering.
Unlike the more traditional supervised training, which requires a given set of inputs and a corresponding set of
outputs, generative backpropagation requires only a given set of outputs. The corresponding inputs
are latent. In other words, they are intialized with small random values (just like the weights), and
they are updated during training (just like the weights).</p>

<p>Let's start with a simple example of using generative backpropagation for dimensionality
reduction. First, let's generate some data. Here is a shell command to generate points in three
dimensions on a Swiss-roll manifold:</p>

<pre class="code">
	waffles_generate swissroll 1000 > swissroll.arff
</pre>

<p>Now, let's write some code to use generative backpropagation to reduce the dimensionality of this
data. We start by loading the data and making a neural network:</p>

<pre class="code">
	GMatrix data;
	data.loadArff("swissroll.arff");
	GNeuralNet decoder;
	decoder.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 24));
	decoder.addLayer(new GLayerClassic(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, FLEXIBLE_SIZE, new GActivationIdentity()));
	decoder.beginIncrementalLearning(data.relation(), data.relation());
	decoder.setLearningRate(0.001);
</pre>

<p>Using GActivationIdentity in the output layer will enable the network to support any range
of output values, but it also makes the network very volatile, so we need to use a very small
learning rate.</p>

<p>Next, we initialize a latent matrix of inputs that correspond with each of the observed
points. These are the intrinsic variables, or low-dimensional encoding of the data.</p>

<pre class="code">
	size_t dims = data.cols();
	GMatrix intrinsics(data.rows(), dims);
	for(size_t i = 0; i &lt; intrinsics.rows(); i++)
	{
		double* pRow = intrinsics[i];
		for(size_t j = 0; j &lt; dims; j++)
			*(pRow++) = 0.03 * decoder.rand().normal();
	}
</pre>

<p>We will also need one extra layer to facilitate updating the intrinsic vectors.
In this case, we do not add it to the neural network. We just use it as a stand-alone layer.</p>

<pre class="code">
	GLayerClassic intrinsicLayer(FLEXIBLE_SIZE, 3, new GActivationIdentity());
</pre>
